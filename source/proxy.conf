### Java FTP Proxy Server
### configuration file
#the ip_users is used for us to make a balance solution
#we can decided which account to access any ipaddress and port

#The port on which the proxy should listen for incoming
#connections. The default is 8089. Note that in earlier
#versions this parameter was named "port".
bind_port=8888

#If your computer has more than one network interface and
#you only want it to accept connections on one you should
#insert the IP-address or hostname of the interface you
#wish to use here.
bind_address=0.0.0.0
# nio threads ,default to cpu number
nio_threads=4
#If you want the IP-address returned by the proxy in 
#response to a PASV command, insert the IP-address or
#hostname here.
#This can be used to provide external access to a ftp
#server behind a NAT firewall or through SSH tunnelling.
#masquerade_host=127.0.0.1

#Ensure that the connections to the data connection comes
#from the same IP as the control connection.
#validate_data_connection=1

#If you want the proxy to act as a transparent gateway to
#an FTP server on some other computer, then set auto_host
#to the IP-address or hostname of that computer here. 
#If you wish to connect to a port other than the default 
#port (21), you should set auto_port as well.
auto_host=0.0.0.0
auto_port=21

#If you do not want the proxy to act as proxy for hosts
#other than auto_host, you should set only_auto to 1. The
#default value is 0.
#only_auto=1

#If you need the proxy to connect to some (or all) hosts
#using passive mode (e.g. if the proxy runs behind a
#NAT'ed firewall), you can specify these here. Note: this
#only concerns traffic between the proxy and FTP servers.
#Whether to use passive mode between the client and the 
#proxy is determined by the client.
#If neither use_passive nor use_active is set, all
#connections are made in active mode. If only use_passive 
#is set, all connections are made in active mode, except
#connections to the hosts mentioned in use_passive.
#If only use_active is set, all connections are made in 
#passive mode, except connections to hosts mentioned in 
#use_active. If both use_passive and use_active are set, 
#all connections are made in passive mode, except 
#connections to hosts mentioned in use_active but not in 
#use_passive.
#If you want all connections to be made in passive mode,
#you should specify an empty string for use_active (it
#should not be commented out).
#The format of the settings is a comma-seperated list of
#IP-addresses/subnets. These may be formatted as either 
#a single IP-adresse, e.g. 123.45.67.89, or as a subnet 
#written like either 123.45.67.89/255.255.254.0 or 
#123.45.67.89/23.
#use_active=192.168.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.1/8,127.0.0.1
#use_passive=
#When using passive mode between the client and the proxy
#and when using active mode between the proxy and the
#server, the proxy chooses a port number to listen for
#data connections. If this port number cannot be chosen
#freely, e.g. due to firewall limititations between the
#client and the proxy or proxy and the server, you can 
#here specify a list of ports that may be used when
#listening for data connections from the server and the
#client respectively.
#Note that these port ranges are only used when the 
#proxy is _listening_ for data connections, i.e. not 
#when running in active mode between the client and the
#proxy or in passive mode between the proxy and the
#server.
#The format is a comma-seperated list of port numbers or
#port ranges written in the format xxxx-yyyy inclusive.
#Note that some servers will refuse to connect to
#privileged ports, i.e. port numbers < 1024.
#If only one port is specified, a slightly different
#technique for binding is used. Hence if you have only
#specified a few ports, you might experience better 
#results if you only specify one. However, you cannot
#have more simultaneous connections than there are ports
#available.
server_bind_ports=1100-1200
#client_bind_ports=3868-3968

#If you want to use the proxy with your webbrowser you
#need to enable URL syntax. However, this might cause
#trouble using the proxy by means of a regular FTP client
#in the (unusual) event that you have a username 
#containing an asterix. The default value is 1.
enable_url_syntax=1


#For debugging purposes, this option makes the proxy
#dump the network dialogue to the standard output.
output_debug_info=1
#proxy connect to client socket timeout ms
client_socket_timeout=60000

### MESSAGES

#If you want another message to be sent to the client 
#upon connect, you should write it here. If only_auto is
#set to 1, the message of the "auto FTP server" will be
#used instead. Defaults to "Java FTP Proxy Server (usage: 
#USERID=user@site) ready."
#msg_connect=

#Message to send to the client if access is denied dut to
#the settings of deny_from and allow_from. Defaults to
#"Access denied - closing connection."
#msg_origin_access_denied=

#Message to send to the client if access is denied due to
#the settings of deny_to and allow_to. Defaults to
#"Access denied - closing connection."
#msg_destination_access_denied=

#Message to send if the client does not supply a username
#of the the form user@site syntax and no auto_host is 
#specified. Defaults to "Incorrect usage - closing 
#connection."
#msg_incorrect_syntax=

#Message to send to the client in event of an unhandled
#exception. The default is "Internal error, closing 
#connection."
#msg_internal_error=

#Message to send to the client if masquerade_host cannot
#be resolved. Defaults to "Unable to resolve address for 
#|masqueradeHostname| - closing connection."
#msg_masqerade_hostname_dns_error=



#configure the transfer file buffer size,it can get the performance improvement.
buffer_size=40960
